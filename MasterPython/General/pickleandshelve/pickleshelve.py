# for saving or pickling an object or object
# objects must be loaded back in the same order they are added
# pickle loads should be able to detect the correct protocol to decode objects
# DONT use pickle files from untrusted sources
# shelves are persisted in .db files
# are unsorted entries like a dictionary
# shelve keys MUST be a string (unlike dictionaryâ€™s)
# files are pickled when saving and unpickled when loading again, can have performance issues
# basically stores some data that the program needs to run without having SQL db
# can have issues with concurrent writing

# The shelve module implements persistent storage for arbitrary Python objects which can be pickled,
# using a dictionary-like API. The shelve module can be used as a simple persistent storage option
# for Python objects when a relational database is overkill. The shelf is accessed by keys, just as with a dictionary.
